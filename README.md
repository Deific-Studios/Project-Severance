# Project Severance

Project Severance is a survival-horror experience that throws you into a relentless game of cat-and-mouse against something far beyond human understanding. Trapped in a forsaken facility buried deep in the shadows of secrecy, you awaken to find yourself hunted by a twisted, otherworldly entity known only as the Anomaly—a creature that defies logic, shifts through the darkness, and stalks you with unnatural precision.

You must navigate winding corridors, abandoned chambers, and decaying environments to piece together an escape. The Anomaly adapts, watching, listening, waiting for every mistake.

Your tools are scarce but vital:

Flashlights reveal what the dark conceals.

Molotovs that provides minimal light and barricades monsters.

Keys that open one newer lock.

Environmental clues and hidden documents whisper fragments of the truth behind the facility—and the monstrous experiment gone wrong.

But survival comes with a cost. Every choice you make tightens the grip of dread, as jumpscares jolt you from false safety and tension builds with every step. Time is running out. The longer you stay, the more unstable reality itself becomes.

Can you sever yourself from the nightmare before the Anomaly claims you? Or will you join the countless victims who thought they could escape?

Project Severance is not just about running — it’s about enduring fear, outthinking the darkness, and surviving long enough to discover the truth.
